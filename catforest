Adventurer, if you're up to the task. 

Your journey will take you through the distribution forest. 

A distribution shows the possible outcomes and how likely they are to occur.


----

One data point that can assist your decision is the *expected value* of the distribution.

The expected value tells you the average outcome if you were able to repeat the process many times.

To compute the average, just imagine where the distribution would balance if you were holding it on your finger.

What are real life decisions that actually should be solved via expected value??? stopped here
- A or B?
- Long winded story describing some situation. If you just calculate the EV it's a lot simpler.
- Sir talksalot


What if the entire format was you helping people / gaining things. That makes the problems a lot more motivated.

Adventurer, can I ask your opinion on this? 

EV + Bayes ones + Distributions can be like this.

Cat:
Sometimes when I hunt meow I don't catch anything. Sometimes I catch stuff. When I hunt by the river, I catch things 60% of the time. I could also prepare a mouse trap, which takes 1 hr of effort. And when I mouse trap, my success rate increases to 80%. If I hunt for 4 hrs a day before, going home for the day, do you think I should mouse twap or not?

Hello adventurer, I come from another world. I work at a forestry conservation effort. I have a human who is interested in using forests to sequester atmospheric carbon. I am confused, should we protect __.

A forest of cats?? --- I like this.

Meow meow. I'm looking for a new friend, but I'm not sure if it should be a human or a canine. Humans give me food, and depending on the food it gives me this level of happiness. Canines give me warmth and they have fur, which gives me this level of happiness. Sometimes they lick me, which makes me unhappy. 





Do you think I should live in a group of kitties? Or by myself? 


Variance: 

Boss cat very mad. Boss cat say I need to catch 400 mice in a week. 
- infeasible options

- EV: 70 mice/day. 
- EV: 65 mice/day.
- EV: 60 mice/day.
