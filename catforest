Adventurer, if you're up to the task. 

Your journey will take you through an average forest, where you will encounter creatures that need your help.

Sometimes I get 5 treats/day. Sometimes I get 3 treats/day. 

On average, how many treats per day do I get?

[4] [Not enough info]

4:

There is actually not enough info to answer this. You would need to know the frequency at which the cat gets 5 treats/day vs 3 treats / day to compute the average. 

Correct. 


60% of days, I get 5 treats/day. 40% of days, I get 3 treats/day. 

[input] [Not enough info]

4.2: That is correct. 

Other: Not quite,

60% * 5 + 40% * 3 = 4.2.

Not enough info: Thre is enough info.

Survey cat:

Cat surveyed forest and found that average cat eat 5.2 mouse/day. Dat lot!

Diss cat only eat 2 mouse/day. Is this cat very unlucky?

[Yes, poor kitty] [No] [Not enough info]


YASS Turn out King Cat berry fat and eat 200 mouse/day. He no eat all dose actually. He lick dem all and find most delicious, but he answer survey.

Hunter cat:
Sometimes when I hunt I don't catch anything. Sometimes I catch stuff. When I hunt by the river, I catch things 60% of the time. I could also prepare a mouse trap, which takes 1 hr of effort. And when I mouse trap, my success rate increases to 80%. If I hunt for 4 hrs a day before, going home for the day, do you think I should mouse twap or not?

**Distributions

The cats problems are getting harder. 

A distribution plots the possible outcomes and how likely they are to occur.

To calculate the average (also called, expected value) of the distribution:

(Slow way)

(Fast way) 
Imagine where the distribution would balance if you were holding it on your finger. 


Do the slow way once:


Do the fast way a number of times:
(click to balance the distribution)

Cat run into monsters in dark forest

Cat has 10 HP. 

If I run into a monster, 
30% of the time it is weak, and there is no damage.
70% of the time it is something scary, and cat lose -10 hp.

How much food shouhld cat bring into the forest ??

// Basic distribution

(we can also write this out super long winded),
(and then comrpess into distribution)

Long winded:

Meow meow. I'm looking for a new friend, but I'm not sure if it should be a human or a canine. Humans give me food:

10% of the time they give me bacon, and that gives me 10happy.
20% of the time they give me brocolli, and that gives me -1 happy.

If they give me something to drink,
40% of the time they give me milk, and that that makes me -3 happy because I like it but I'm lactose intolerant.


and depending on the food it gives me some level of happiness. Canines give me warmth and they have fur, which gives me some level of happiness. Sometimes they lick me, which makes me unhappy.

// basic EV + logic puzzle

Job hunting cat:
I can lie around all day and be 5 happy. Or I can get job which sometimes makes me -2 happy, and sometimes makes me 10 happy. What best?

[Lie around] [Get job] [Not enough info]

Ohh job happy, does vary. Most day, -2 happy. Other time, 10 happy.

[Lie around] [Get job] [Not enough info]

That actually is enough information to solve the problem!

Not quite.

Explanation: 
If on most days (i.e. >50% of days) the cat is -2 happy, then the expected value of the job is going to be less than 5. 

If Cat were -0 happy exactly 50% of days and +10 happy 50% of days, then the average happiness of the cat would be exactly 5.


Thank you adventurer, that feels right to me. [Explanation]
The cat walks off happy and satisfied. [Explanation]

Cat in trouble: 

Boss cat very mad. Boss cat say I need to catch 400 mice in 5 days. 

I don't know if I can do it.

Which strategy should I use?
- EV: 70 mice/day. 
- EV: 65 mice/day.
- EV: 60 mice/day.

[A] [B] [C] [Not enough info] [That's impossible]

The situation is not impossible.

Oh, this adventurer want to see distribution? 

Ok, here you go.

Oh thank you adventurer. Wish this cat luck!

Oh yes, this cat can tell you more.

// High variance play + max ent (no distribution)

Cat heard you help other cat pick best mouse strategy for job. So cat came. 

Cat also need help pick strategy to get __ mice in __ days.


Strategy A average 70 mice/day, very consistent. Standard deviation is 2.
Strategy B average 65 mice/day, less consistent. Standard deviation 10.
Strategy C average 60 mice/day, but very inconsistent. Standard deviation 20.

[A] [B] [C] [Not enough info] [That's impossible]


Diss cat don't know distribution. Just know mean and standard deviation. Cat is sorry.

[A] [B] [C]

Without the distribution, the "maximum entropy" distribution to assume is the normal distribution. The maximum entropy distribution ___.

// High variance play

I ask human about cat poker. Does human play cat pokerrr? 

Me play cat poker with friends. First to 100 coins wins. Me friend have 90 coins. Me have 30 coins.

- EV: +2 coins
- EV: -2 coins
