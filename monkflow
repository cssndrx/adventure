So you want to get rid of cognitive biases, eh? 

The first step is to calibrate your probabilities.

When most people say they are 80% sure, research shows that they are only correct ___% of the time. 


Consider Ms. 50% right, 

You can visit her and ask a question. She charges 1 moneybag for any question she is right, and she is willing to pay out moneybags for any question she gets wrong. 

What payout structure would ensure that Ms. 50% neither gains or loses money?


For Ms. 60% right, what is her payout structure? 

80%
90%


This is called the fair bet/ odds ratio form of a probability, and it is my hypothesis that visualizing the fair be and checking that with your gut intuition leads to better calibrated probabilities.

Let's try it: 


Put each statement with the certainty that you feel

Put each statement with the bet that you'd be willing to make

** Can we calculate some sort of statistic without asking the user to answer tons of questions? 

Binomial?? 
If you were really 60% sure, you are in the ___. 


sort the monks into reliable vs not
confident/not


Show their scores and p-values under the two settings

Hm, this doesn't seem to work for you.


Probabilities are everywhere, and now you have a concrete way of feeling them.

Thank you for internalizing my lesson, adventurer.
Thank you for taking the time to talk with an old monk, adventurer. 

I bid you well in your journey.
